            <h1>What are EM and REM</h1>
            <h2>EM and REM are scalable CSS Units.</h2>
            <p>When working with responsive design using EM and Rem
                    allows us to scale our elements up and down, rather
                    than working with fixed units such as pixels.
            </p>
        </div>
    
    <div class="rem">
        <h2>EM</h2>
        <h3>Em is unit of measure relative to the font size of
            the nearest parent element. In this example this would 
            be our div with the class of "em".
        </h3>
        <p>If our "em" div has a "font-size" value et to 20px
            then 1em=20px and 10em=200px etc.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="rem">
        <h2>REM</h2>
        <h3>rem is unit of measure relative to the font size of 
            the root/html element, which if not specifically 
            set will default to 10px.
        </h3>
        <p>if the font-size of our root/ html isn't overwritten
            1rem=16px.
